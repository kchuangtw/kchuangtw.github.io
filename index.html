      Introduction
      ------------

      You are asked to create an online store in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      Please implement a store with all of the following requirements.

      You may remove this comment and place all your HTML in this file.

      Requirements:

      1. Include a header across the top with your store' s name, a logo, and use a different background colour, web
      font, etc. Your header should include info about what the store is, what it sells, etc. Use some images to try and
      draw the user in. NOTE: place all your site's images in the `src/images/` directory. 2. Below the header, a
      multi-column layout of items you can purchase in the store. You must have at least 10 items in your store, and at
      least 2 categories of items. For example, if you are selling clothing, you might have categories for Men, Women,
      and Children, and each category would have its own set of items. Each item should include: - a picture of the item
      - the item's name or title - a complete description of the item - a category (i.e., each item must belong to one
      or more categories) - a price in Canadian Dollars Each item should be its own "card" (i.e., some kind of box
      around each item separating one from the next, with suitable whitespace between). 3. A category menu or "sidebar"
      (left, right, or top depending on your design) showing the different categories of items in your store. If a user
      clicks on one of the categories, use CSS and JavaScript to hide all other items in the store (i.e., only show
      items for the chosen category). Make sure you include a way to return to seeing all categories, and make it
      obvious to the user that they are only seeing a partial list of items when you filter by category (i.e., use CSS
      and HTML to change things somehow). 4. Below the store items, a footer with the name of the store, any relevant
      links you need to give users. Include links and icons to any social media for your store (Facebook, Twitter, etc).
      NOTE: you don't have to create such accounts, but you can provide links to imaginary accounts. 5. Use at least two
      different Web Fonts for your store. The titles should be different from any regular text. Use a free font service
      like https://fonts.google.com/ or any other that you choose. You can also experiment with different font sizes and
      colours to draw attention toward or away from various parts of your design. 6. Pick a colour theme using a tool
      like https://colorhunt.co/ with at least 3 colours (primary, secondary, accent), and use them throughout your site
      for backgrounds, borders, fonts. Your store page needs to look attractive and marks will be given for good a good
      looking site. No one will buy from a store that looks like its owners aren't professional or don't care about
      details. Also make sure that the colour contrast in your site is suitable for everyone to read. 7. Use modern CSS
      to help you achieve your layout. For example, Flexbox and CSS Grid can help you create professional looking
      layouts. Here are some guides to get you started: -
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox -
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout You are also
      welcome to use existing CSS libraries to help you with your layout, but you must also include your own styles
      (i.e., you can't use a library for everything in your design). 8. Make sure you don't use copyrighted materials
      from other sites. If you use icons, fonts, images, etc., make sure you are legally permitted to reuse them, and
      include references to indicate where you got them. Some resources to consider: - https://unsplash.com/ for images
      - https://fontawesome.com/ for icons - https://gallery.manypixels.co/ or https://undraw.co/illustrations for
      illustrations (SVG) 9. Make sure you reduce the download size of images you include in your store. Your images
      shouldn't be larger than 1M in size. Users don't want to download 10s or 100s of megabytes of data, especially on
      mobile. You can use an online tool like https://squoosh.app/ to help you reduce images. You will lose marks if
      your images aren't optimized for the web. 10. Make sure you have no JavaScript or other errors in your Dev Tools
      Console. Run your site, and test all aspects of it with the Console open, and fix any issues you encounter. 11.
      Make sure your code is properly indented and commented, and that you've used good naming practices for variables,
      functions, ids, classes, etc. 12. Have fun! Build something you'd be proud to show future employers in interviews.
      Take the time to properly design and implement a beautiful and functional storefront. Maybe it will inspire you to
      start your own online business? -->
